# How to Crimp Dupont Cables

Materials you will need:
- Dupont connector pins
- Dupont connector housing
- Crimping tool
- Wire stripper
- Wire cutter
- Stranded wire

## Step 1: Cut the wire to the desired length
Using the wire cutter, cut the stranded wire to the desired length. Make sure to leave a little extra length for stripping and crimping.

## Step 2: Strip the wire
Using the wire stripper, strip about 3mm of insulation off the end of the wire. Be careful not to damage the strands of the wire.

## Step 3: Insert the wire into the connector pin
Insert the stripped end of the wire into the connector pin. Make sure the wire goes all the way into the pin and that the strands are lined up evenly with the end of the pin.

## Step 4: Crimp the connector pin
Using the crimping tool, crimp the pin onto the wire. Be sure to position the crimping tool so that it is centered on the pin and that the jaws of the tool are fully engaged before squeezing.

## Step 5: Insert the pin into the connector housing
Insert the pin into the appropriate slot in the connector housing. Make sure the pin clicks into place and that the wire is held firmly in the housing.

## Step 6: Repeat for other wires
Repeat steps 2-5 for each wire that needs to be crimped onto a connector pin.

## Step 7: Connect the connectors
Once all the wires are crimped and inserted into the connector housing, you can connect the connectors to each other. Be sure to match the pins and sockets properly so that they click into place and the connection is secure.
