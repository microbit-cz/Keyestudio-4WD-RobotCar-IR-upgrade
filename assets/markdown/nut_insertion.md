# inserting a Insertion Nut

Step 1:
Make sure the 3D printed part is clean and free of any debris or rough edges. If necessary, use sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots.


Step 2: Prepare the insertion nut
Using pliers, hold the nut in place and insert a screw into the threaded hole to make sure the threads are clean and aligned.

Step 3: Insert the insertion nut
Carefully place the insertion nut (thread down) on the hole of the 3D printed part. Hold the nut in place with pliers, ensuring that it is level and centered in the hole.




Step 4: Apply heat with the soldering gun
With the insertion nut held in place, touch the tip of the soldering gun to the nut. Apply heat for a few seconds, until the nut begins to melt into the 3D printed part, make sure you leave ~1mm on the top.

Step 5: Allow to cool
Once the nut has melted into the 3D printed part, remove the soldering gun and allow the part to cool. This should only take a few seconds.
